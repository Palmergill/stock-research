## Frontend Entry Points

The active public site is static:

- `/` - portfolio/project launcher from `index.html`
- `/docs/` - protected website documentation from `docs/index.html`
- `/stock-research/` - stock research app
- `/poker/` - poker app
- `/craps/` - craps app
- `/blackjack/` - blackjack app
- `/bitcoin-chat/` - Bitcoin chat app
- `/admin/` - protected backend log dashboard

Earlier stock-app frontends are retained under `archive/` and are not served by default.

## Backend

The backend is a FastAPI service in `backend/app`.

Important routes:

- `/api/stocks/*`
- `/api/poker/*`
- `/api/bitcoin/*`
- `/api/admin/*`
- `/health`
- `/docs` - protected FastAPI docs when accessing the backend service directly

In production, `/` returns API metadata from the Railway API service. In local development, `./start.sh` sets `LOCAL_SITE_ROOT=true`, which makes FastAPI serve the root portfolio page and most active static project folders from the same process.

The active deployed API is `backend/app/main.py`. `poker/backend/` contains a standalone poker service with additional endpoints, tests, and deployment files, but the root `Dockerfile` does not copy or run it.

## Local Development

```bash
./start.sh
```

## Deployment

- Static site hosting serves the root static files and project directories.
- Vercel rewrites `/api/*` to the Railway API.
- Railway runs the Dockerized FastAPI backend from `backend/`.
- `/`, `/poker/`, `/craps/`, `/blackjack/`, and `/api/poker/*` are public. Stock research, Bitcoin chat, admin, and other API routes require Basic Auth when app auth is configured.
