**Strong hands** (raise):
- AA, KK, QQ, AK suited

**Good hands** (call/raise):
- JJ, TT, AQ, AJ suited, KQ suited

**Marginal hands** (careful):
- Low pairs, suited connectors

**Weak hands** (usually fold):
- Unsuited low cards, disconnected hands

### Position Matters

- **Dealer (Button)**: Best position - act last
- **Early position**: Act first - play tighter
- **Late position**: Can play more hands

### Reading the Board

Watch for:
- **Flush draws**: 3 cards of same suit
- **Straight draws**: Sequential cards
- **Paired board**: Possible full houses

### Bluffing

AI opponents have different personalities:
- Some fold easily to aggression
- Others call too much
- Adjust your strategy accordingly
