# Changelog

All notable changes to the Texas Hold'em Poker app docs and active app wiring are tracked here.

The production poker app is currently the static frontend in `poker/` plus the shared backend router in `backend/app/routers/poker.py`.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Updated poker docs to distinguish the active shared backend from the standalone `poker/backend/` service.
- Updated API documentation to list only endpoints exposed by the active shared backend.
- Updated architecture and task docs to remove stale claims about inactive production endpoints.

## Current Active Feature Set

The active root deployment supports:

- Single-player poker against five AI bots.
- Multiplayer lobby creation, joining, and host start.
- Polling-based game state updates.
- Fold, check, call, raise, buy-back, and next-hand actions.
- In-memory game state with one-hour inactivity cleanup.
- Static frontend themes, card deck themes, stats stored in browser storage, generated sound effects, haptics, mobile gestures, PWA manifest, and service worker.

## Standalone Backend Notes

`poker/backend/` contains a separate, richer FastAPI service with its own historical changelog-worthy work: tournaments, persistence, analytics, security middleware, backups, spectators, detailed health endpoints, and pytest coverage. Those features are not active in the root Railway deployment unless the deployment is changed to run that service.

The earlier versioned changelog entries described that standalone service. They were consolidated here to avoid presenting inactive endpoints as production behavior.
